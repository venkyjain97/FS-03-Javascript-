//Write a JavaScript program that defines a variable called "message" and assigns it the value "Hello, world!". Use console.log() to display the message in the console.


var message = "Hello, world!";
console.log(message);


//Then, modify the program to define another variable called "name" and assign it your own name. Use console.log() to display a personalised message that includes both the "message" variable and the "name" variable.


var message = "Hello, world!";
var name = "John";

console.log(message + " My name is " + name + ".");
